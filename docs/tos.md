# Terms of Service

Last updated: December 1, 2025

By using this bot (“the Bot”), you agree to the following Terms of Service.

## 1. Purpose
The Bot is designed to assist server administrators and moderators with **community health and safety monitoring**.  
It provides signals and alerts based on behavioral patterns but **does not automatically punish users**.

## 2. Data Collection
The Bot may collect and temporarily process:
- User IDs
- Server IDs
- Event timestamps (e.g., reactions, joins)
- Detection signals (e.g., fast reactions, suspicious phrases)

The Bot **does not store message content** or read private messages.

## 3. Moderation Responsibility
All decisions regarding moderation actions (timeouts, bans, warnings) are the responsibility of server staff.  
The Bot only provides informational alerts.

## 4. Limitations
The Bot may generate false positives and should be used as a **support tool**, not a final authority.

## 5. Availability
The Bot is provided “as is” with no guarantee of uptime or accuracy.

## 6. Abuse
You may not use the Bot for harassment, surveillance, or attempts to deanonymize users.

## 7. Changes
These Terms may be updated at any time. Continued use of the Bot indicates acceptance of updated terms.

If you do not agree with these Terms, discontinue use of the Bot.
